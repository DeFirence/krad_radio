Thoughts on Krad GUI

Perhaps this should be called Krad Graphics, or Krad HUD, naming issues aside, what this is right now is a collection
of mostly non-interactive graphics to be displayed as a video overlay or as 'status information' about what an application is doing.

All of the drawing is done with cairo, and most things are resolution independant, it is not tied to GTK or anything, graphics
can be rendered and then used in OpenGL, or encoded 'burned in' to a video frame, or whatever you want if you know how to work a
RGBA bit buffer.

There is several goals here, one is a much more comprehensive "whats this application doing behind the scenes" status display.
Far to often users just see "Buffering" with a spinner, this is fairly pathetic, what can be done is to show buffer levels, and show
if the problem is the connection, the speed of the connection, the sever never responded, etc. I think this can all be displayed in several
simple and intuitive ways.

The other goal is 'broadcast graphics package', video overlays for date/time, titling, tickers, logos and on and on.
