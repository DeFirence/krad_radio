This is experimental software intended for developers only, you have been warned.

To build things, we have waf, which should be way awesome fun, because waf 
is perfect and everything always builds everywhere, as we all know.

If you have not used waf, it works like this:

./waf configure
./waf
sudo ./waf install

./waf clean and ./waf distclean can be usefull

Need to add option builds currently all deps need to be met for tools.

["vorbis", "speex", "speexdsp", "opus", "sdl", "orc-0.4", "schroedinger-1.0", "gtk+-3.0", 
 "gl", "glu", "flac", "libpulse", "jack", "alsa", "vpx", "libswscale", "libavutil"]

These are for the tools only, krad ebml library has no deps.

It will create a subdir called build in this directory, where you will find the results of its doing.

And most importantly...
