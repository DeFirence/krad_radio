This is experimental software intended for developers only, you have been warned.

To build things, we have waf, which should be way awesome fun, because waf 
is perfect and everything always builds everywhere, as we all know.

If you have not used waf, it works like this:

./waf configure
./waf
sudo ./waf install

./waf clean and ./waf distclean can be usefull

Need to add option builds currently all deps need to be met for tools.

["vorbis", "speex", "speexdsp", "opus", "sdl", "orc-0.4", "schroedinger-1.0", "gtk+-3.0", 
 "gl", "glu", "flac", "libpulse", "jack", "alsa", "vpx", "libswscale", "libavutil"]

These are for the tools only, krad ebml library has no deps.

ubuntu hint:

sudo apt-get install libspeex-dev libspeexdsp-dev libsdl1.2-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev libvorbis-dev \
gtk-3.0 libswscale-dev libflac-dev libschroedinger-dev libavutil-dev libjack-dev libvpx-dev build-essential


And install opus from git: http://opus-codec.org/downloads/

git clone http://git.xiph.org/opus.git
sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf git-core libtool
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install && sudo ldconfig

ubutntu vpx did not give me a pkg-config file so to compile that..

git clone http://git.chromium.org/webm/libvpx.git
sudo apt-get install yasm
make
sudo make install


It will create a subdir called build in this directory, where you will find the results of its doing.

And most importantly...
