This is experimental software intended for developers only, you have been warned.

To build things, we have waf, which should be way awesome fun, because waf 
is perfect and everything always builds everywhere, as we all know.

If you have not used waf, it works like this:

./waf configure
./waf
sudo ./waf install

./waf clean and ./waf distclean can be usefull

Need to add option builds currently all deps need to be met for tools.

These are for the apps/tools only, krad ebml library has no deps.

ubuntu hint:

sudo apt-get install libspeex-dev libspeexdsp-dev libsdl1.2-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev libvorbis-dev \
gtk-3.0 libswscale-dev libflac-dev libschroedinger-dev libavutil-dev libjack-dev libvpx-dev build-essential


And install opus from git: http://opus-codec.org/downloads/

git clone http://git.xiph.org/opus.git
sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf git-core libtool
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install && sudo ldconfig

ubutntu vpx did not give me a pkg-config file so to compile that..

git clone http://git.chromium.org/webm/libvpx.git
sudo apt-get install yasm
make
sudo make install

It will create a subdir called build in this directory, where you will find the results of its doing.

libjpeg-turbo and its confusingly differently named api turbojpeg seems to be missing a pkg-config (.pc) file
on most linux distros.

Install the distro -dev package, or install from http://www.libjpeg-turbo.org/

Put this pkg-config file in /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/turbojpeg.pc if you installed from source
or /usr/lib/pkgconfig/turbojpeg.pc if from packages
Something fishy maybe going on or its really just missing, not sure but this has worked for a few people


# turbojpeg installed pkg-config file

prefix=/usr/local
exec_prefix=/usr/local
libdir=/usr/local/lib
includedir=/usr/local/include

Name: turbojpeg
Description: turbojpeg
Version: 1.2.0
Conflicts:
Libs: -L${libdir} -lturbojpeg
Cflags: -I${includedir}

And most importantly...
