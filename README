### Overview

Krad Radio is a daemon that is controlled locally or remotely by Krad Radio clients.
Clients are written using the Krad Radio clientlib, writing clients that directly speak
the Krad Radio IPC protocol is not advisable or supported. Clients can be command line, 
ncurses, GUI or web based, and any number of clients can be connected to the daemon at 
any time. This design is directly inspired from the design of XMMS2.

The Krad Radio daemon can be thought of in three parts, the mixer, the compositor and 
the linker.

                      [Krad Compositor]
 [Incoming Links] >>                     >>  [Outgoing Links]
                      [Krad Mixer]


Links can be a variety of things, files, network streams, or local A/V hardware.

Capture Support: V4L2, Decklink, X11, Jack, PulseAudio, ALSA

### Codec and container support

Krad Radio natively supports a certain set of container and codecs that
are suited for its purpose. Native support meaning that KR interfaces
directly with the codecs and containers for the most precise control possible.

Support of non-native codecs will be though Jack for audio, and gstreamer audio
and video sinks. Videojack should it come back to life will also be supported, or 
should there be some other local shared memory video routing software come into
existence. 

All native codecs will work in Ogg and MKV containers for incoming and outgoing links.
For UDP and WebRTC connections, only a subset will be supported, Opus for audio and TBD
for video.

Native Containers Ogg, MKV/WebM, Krad UDP*
Planned Containers: TransOgg, WebRTC 

Native Codec Support List

Current Video: VP8 (libvpx), Theora, Dirac*
Planned Video: VP8 (xvp8), daala
Thinking about it: DNxHD, CinemaDNG

Current Audio: Opus, Vorbis, FLAC, Codec2*

* Code existing, but not fully baked
