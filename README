This is experimental software intended for developers only, you have been warned.

To build things, we have waf, which should be way awesome fun, because waf 
is perfect and everything always builds everywhere, as we all know.

If you have not used waf, it works like this:

./waf configure
./waf
sudo ./waf install

./waf clean and ./waf distclean can be usefull

Need to add option builds currently all deps need to be met for tools.

These are for the apps/tools only, krad ebml library has no deps.

ubuntu hint:

sudo apt-get install libspeex-dev libspeexdsp-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev libvorbis-dev freeglut3-dev \
libgtk-3-dev libswscale-dev libflac-dev libschroedinger-dev libavutil-dev libjack-dev git subversion yasm build-essential \
libgl1-mesa-dev libxcb-util0-dev libx11-xcb-dev libxcb1-dev 

And install opus from git: http://opus-codec.org/downloads/

git clone http://git.xiph.org/opus.git
sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf git-core libtool
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install && sudo ldconfig

And install libvpx:

git clone http://git.chromium.org/webm/libvpx.git
make
sudo make install && sudo ldconfig

libjpeg-turbo and its confusingly differently named api turbojpeg seems to be missing a pkg-config (.pc) file
on most linux distros. http://www.libjpeg-turbo.org/

so install libjpeg-turbo:

*PITFALL*
be sure to set the prefix to /usr/local! it defaults to /opt (who know why?)

svn co https://libjpeg-turbo.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/libjpeg-turbo/branches/1.2.x libjpeg-turbo
cd libjpeg-turbo/
mkdir build
autoreconf -fiv
cd build/
sh ../configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
sudo make install && sudo ldconfig

turbojpeg missing package config file oh no! make one:

Put this pkg-config file in: /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/turbojpeg.pc


# turbojpeg installed pkg-config file

prefix=/usr/local
exec_prefix=/usr/local
libdir=/usr/local/lib
includedir=/usr/local/include

Name: turbojpeg
Description: turbojpeg
Version: 1.2.0
Conflicts:
Libs: -L${libdir} -lturbojpeg
Cflags: -I${includedir}




And most importantly...
