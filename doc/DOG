A watchdog daemon is built into the Krad Radio clientlib.

The point of it is to ensure specified Krad Radio station daemons are running.
At this time Krad Radio is not 100% stable, it could crash and quit or get 
into an unresponsive state.

Using the dog is completely optional, and what it does could also be done by 
cron and some scripts or the perhaps some other program, but the dog should
suit many peoples needs, without the ducktape of cron and the dependency of
another program. 

The dog works on a few simple priniples, the user wants to have X number of 
Krad Radio stations running, and if they have crash or become unresponsive,
the dog should fix this problem right away.

The dog attempts to connect to all the stations specified, if the connection
is successful, the dog assumes everything is ok. If not, the dog will check for
and kill any stalled daemon, and launch a new instance.

Note: It is the responsibility of the daemon to ensure any specific operation
such as a stream connection to another server is up and running, the dog simply
tries to connect as a Krad Radio client to a Krad Radio daemon.

To launch the dog daemon do this:

krad_radio dog ~/my_dog_config.conf

The config file is very simple, it is simply a list of station sysnames,
optionally, but most likely, followed by a station startup script.


Example:

station1 ~/launch_station1.rb
station2
station3 ~/station3/run_station3.py
