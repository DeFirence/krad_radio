Thoughts on Krad Display

This is just a simple wrapper using SDL to open up an opengl or overlay window. Its using SDL for now, but perhaps i'll switch to GLX or 
whatever to open up the window, all SDL is doing is the dirty mess of opening the window. GLX is bizare in its own right, I look forward to
wayland taking over.. Altho there is code here for overlay, that maybe passe already, I don't expect to make any use of it.

Perhaps this is where I will add code for managing precision frame PTS sync.
